Browse Twitch, get stream notifications, and listen to streams right from your Discord server.

We have made Streamcord open-sourced to show how a functional example of how a Discord bot can connect to and interface with the Discord API, and so that the community can help contribute to and improve Streamcord even further.

This repo does not include code for the notifications handler.

> The code published in this repo is very outdated. We plan to release the Java rewrite source code on GitHub once we are nearing a public beta.

Browse Twitch, get stream notifications, and listen to streams right from your Discord server.

We have made Streamcord open-sourced to show how a functional example of how a Discord bot can connect to and interface with the Discord API, and so that the community can help contribute to and improve Streamcord even further.
